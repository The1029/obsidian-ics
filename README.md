# Obsidian ICS Plugin

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It adds events from google calendar ics URLs to your Daily Note on demand.

This only works with the Daily Note or [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) plugins: specifically it gets the date to search for events during from the currently open daily note.

## Installation

This plugin is in the community plugin browser in Obsidian. Search for ICS and you can install it from there.

## Usage

1. From Google Calendar, look for the calendar in the left sidebar click the vertical â€¦ menu, Settings and Sharing, Integrate calendar, Copy the Secret address in iCal format
2. Enter that URL into settings with a calendar name
3. Customize your format settings. Some are per calendar, others are for all calendars.
   - Per calendar settings: Whether to include the event end time, the calendar name, event summary, event location, event description
   - General output settings: Time [format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/).
4. Go to a daily note, use the `ICS: Import events` command
